# Setup and Preparation

This project needs a backend first:

- Start the Book-Dummy-Backend with `npx bookmonkey-api`

### Executing the attack

- Navigate to the application `xss-attack` in your terminal
- Install the dependencies `npm install`
- Start the application with `npm start`
- Inject following malicious JavaScript inside the `Abstract`-Input field: `<iframe src="javascript:alert('xss')">`
- Investigate the Angular Code - Do you know how the attack could happen?
- Fix the code :)

### Hint

- The malicious code got injected within the `BookCardComponent`
